QueuedMethod

=====

This module allows you to have methods automatically queued and cached for 
certain periods of time and updating themselves once the
a certain staleness has set in.  Cache keys at various stages 
of job creation and running prevent dog piling.  

Right now, QueuedMethod does not work on methods that require arguments though
it could be extended similarly to Memoization.

Current version requires Delayed::Job but job queue can easily be overridden with other queues.

USAGE:

Add to your ActiveRecord model with:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      extend QueuedMethod 
      ...

To use the queued_method, use the following as an example (showcasing all options (none of which are required)).

    ...
    def faster_function
      LookupYesterdaysDataFromDatabase
    end

    def a_really_slow_function
      GetCurrentInfoFromAnotherWebService
    end
    queued_method :a_really_slow_function, 
        :expires_in => 1.hour, 
        :stale_in   => 45.minutes, 
        :fallback   => :faster_function,
        :force      => ENV['RAILS_ENV'] == 'development'
    ...

OPTIONS
  :expires_in => TIME
    Set the lifetime for the cache.  If this is left blank, the cache will not last until the cache_key changes (See below)

  :stale_in => TIME_LESS_THAN_EXPIRES_IN
    Set when the cache should be considered stale so that updating can be put into job queue.
    If :expires_in is not set but :stale_in is, the cache won't expire with time, but will be 
    updated as a job and freshened as necessary.  If the :stale_in is not set or is greater than 
    :expires_in the cache will not ever be created ahead of time.

  :fallback => SYMBOL_FOR_OTHER_METHOD
    This allows you to assign a function to call instead of the base method if the cache is expired 
    the base method is added to the job queue.  

  :force => SHOULD_THE_CACHING_BE_SKIPPED?
    This option allows you to disable the caching in certain environments. If you have a fallback function,
    that option will be used if force is set to true.

To use, just call the base function as you normally would.  

  ...
  @info = a_really_slow_function


If you want to dump the cached info on the method, call the method with the option of true

  ...
  @info = a_really_slow_function(true)
